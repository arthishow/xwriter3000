System Requirements
-------------------
Linux 64 bit, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Java version: 1.8.0_151, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Apache Maven 3.3.9
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.20, for Linux (x86_64)

Now you have the database needed.

Then open two terminals on Xwriter3000Server directory.

With one of them run:

mvn compile

mvn install

Then run on one of the terminals:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="main"

and on the other:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="recovery"

The main server and the recovery server are running now,

Open another terminal on Xwriter3000Client directory and run:

mvn compile

mvn install

Then for starting the application run:

mvn exec:java


Usage
-----
The log-in interface contains three fields: username, password and personal code. You only need to fill the personal code field if you have created an account on a different machine than the one you are using currently. You can find your personal code under Options>Display personal code in the book selection window once you're logged in on the machine you created the account.

Under Manage Authorizations you can give and revoke access to the book selected to other users. A user with a level 2 only has reading rights on your book, a user with a level 1 has reading and writing rights on your book, and a user with a level 0 is the owner of the book and has reading and writing rights on it.
Only the owner of the book can grant or revoke authorizations, the other authors can only see who has been authorized and with what level.

When creating books you will always need to hit the Refresh button to see them in the list.
